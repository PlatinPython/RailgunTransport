# Railgun Transport

Transport by Railgun. This is all you ever dreamt of.

This mod adds a powerful railgun, which shoots capsules that you load up with items towards a target.
Just tell the railgun which target to focus, and it will align itself for the shot.

To build the railgun or target multiblocks, you first need a few (quite costly) resources:

For the base of either of them, you need:
**5x Smooth Stone, 2x Block of Iron, 1x Block of Redstone, 1 Block of Netherite**

Assemble these as shown below, north is up.

Now you can decide if you want a railgun or a target.
For a railgun, you need:
**2x Polished Blackstone, 2x Polished Blackstone Wall, 2x Block of Diamond, 1x Block of Copper, 1x Polished Blackstone
Stairs, 1x Dispenser**

Assemble these on top of the first layer of blocks as shown below.

For a target, you need:
**4x Polished Blackstone, 2x Polished Blackstone Wall, 1x Block of Diamond, 1x Block of Copper, 1x Observer**

Finally, the terminal and the capsules are crafted in a crafting table the following ways:
